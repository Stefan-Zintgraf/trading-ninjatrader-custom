# OnRenderTargetChanged()

# OnRenderTargetChanged()

## [Definition](./onrendertargetchanged.md)

Called whenever a Chart's **RenderTarget** is created or destroyed. `OnRenderTargetChanged()` is used for creating / cleaning up resources such as a **SharpDX.Direct2D1.Brush** used throughout your NinjaScript class.

*   A **RenderTarget** will be created and destroyed several times during the lifetime of a chart. For example, a user resizing the chart would cause the **RenderTarget** to be re\-created as the chart is rendered to reflect the new dimensions. Another example is when a user clicks on the chart as a **RenderTarget** is used during **hit testing**. Since there are multiple **RenderTargets**, you MUST ensure the resource being used belongs to the destination target. In practice, all you need to understand is if you are using a device resource (e.g., custom **SharpDX Brush**) throughout different event methods, you should recreate these resource during `OnRenderTargetChanged()` which ensures the device resource is updated correctly as the devices context changes.
*   During initialization your NinjaScript indicators and strategies are guaranteed to see **State.Configure** before `OnRenderTargetChanged()` would be called.

## Note

## [Method Return Value](./onrendertargetchanged.md)

This method does not return a value.

## [Syntax](./onrendertargetchanged.md)

You may override the method in your indicator with the following syntax:

`public override void OnRenderTargetChanged() { }`

![note image](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FWarning.3bcf24ba.svg&w=64&q=75)

## Warning

*   Each DirectX **render target** requires its own brushes. You must create a brushes directly in `OnRender()` or using **OnRenderTargetChanged()**. If you do not you will receive an error at run time similar to: "A direct X error has occurred while rendering the chart: HRESULT: \[0x88990015\], Module: \[SharpDX.Direct2D1\], ApiCode: \[D2DERR\_WRONG\_RESOURCE\_DOMAIN/WrongResourceDomain\], Message: The resource was realized on the wrong render target. : Each DirectX render target requires its own brushes. You must create brushes directly in `OnRender()` or using **OnRenderTargetChanged()**. Please see the example below on using **OnRenderTargetChanged()** with brush that needs to be recalculated, or **OnRender()** for an example of recreating a static brush.

## [Parameters](./onrendertargetchanged.md)

This method does not accept any parameters.

## Note

*   If you are exclusively using resources in **OnRender()** (e.g., not passing values from **OnStateChange()** or other events) you only need to create and dispose of the resource in **OnRender()**. The **OnRenderTargetChanged()** concepts illustrated below would not need to be applied.
*   For a walk through for using the **SharpDX RenderTarget**, please see the educational resource [Using SharpDX for Custom Chart Rendering](./using_sharpdx_for_custom_chart_rendering.md).

### Recalculating a SharpDX Brush conditionally in OnBarUpdate()

```csharp

private SharpDX.Direct2D1.Brush dxBrush = null; // the SharpDX brush used for rendering
private System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush brushColor; // used to determine the color of the brush conditionally

protected override void OnStateChange()
{
   if (State == State.SetDefaults)
   {
     Name = "OnRenderTargetChanged Example";
     IsOverlay = false;
   }
}

protected override void OnBarUpdate()
{
   if (Close[0] > Open[0])
   {
     brushColor = Brushes.Green;
   }
   else if (Close[0] < Open[0])
   {
     brushColor = Brushes.Red;
   }
   else brushColor = Brushes.Blue;
}

public override void OnRenderTargetChanged()
{
   // if dxBrush exists on first render target change, dispose of it
   if (dxBrush != null)
   {
     dxBrush.Dispose();
   }

   // recalculate dxBrush from value calculated in OnBarUpdated when RenderTarget is recreated
   if (RenderTarget != null)
     dxBrush = brushColor.ToDxBrush(RenderTarget);
}

protected override void OnRender(ChartControl chartControl, ChartScale chartScale)
{
   // fill a custom SharpDX rectangle using the dx brush
   RenderTarget.FillRectangle(new SharpDX.RectangleF(ChartPanel.X, ChartPanel.Y, ChartPanel.W, ChartPanel.H), dxBrush);
}


```

### Recalculating a SharpDX Brush based on user input

```csharp

private SharpDX.Direct2D1.Brush dxBrush = null; // the SharpDX brush used for rendering

protected override void OnStateChange()
{
   if (State == State.SetDefaults)
   {
     Name = "OnRenderTargetChanged Example";
     IsOverlay = false;
     UserBrush = Brushes.Red; // user selection pushed to the UI
   }
}

public override void OnRenderTargetChanged()
{
   // if dxBrush exists on first render target change, dispose of it
   if (dxBrush != null)
   {
     dxBrush.Dispose();
   }

   // recalculate dxBrush from user defined brush when RenderTarget is recreated
   if (RenderTarget != null)
     dxBrush = UserBrush.ToDxBrush(RenderTarget);
}

protected override void OnRender(ChartControl chartControl, ChartScale chartScale)
{
   // fill a custom SharpDX rectangle using the dx brush
   RenderTarget.FillRectangle(new SharpDX.RectangleF(ChartPanel.X, ChartPanel.Y, ChartPanel.W, ChartPanel.H), dxBrush);
}

[XmlIgnore]
public Brush UserBrush { get; set; } // brush selection set by user in UI

[Browsable(false)]
public string MyBrushSerialize // string used to serialize selection set by user in UI
{
   get { return Serialize.BrushToString(UserBrush); }
   set { UserBrush = Serialize.StringToBrush(value); }
}
