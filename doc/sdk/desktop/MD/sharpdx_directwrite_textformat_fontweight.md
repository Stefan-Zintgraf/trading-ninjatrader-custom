## Note

Notes:

1.  Weight differences are generally differentiated by an increased stroke or thickness that is associated with a given character in a typeface, as compared to a "normal" character from that same typeface.
2.  Not all weights are available for all typefaces. When a weight is not available for a typeface, the closest matching weight is returned.
3.  Font weight values less than 1 or greater than 999 are considered invalid, and they are rejected by font API functions.

## [Property Value](./sharpdx_directwrite_textformat_fontweight.md)
