# Swing

## [Description](./swing.md)

The **Swing** indicator will plot lines that represent the swing points based on the strength (number of bars to the left and right of the swing point) parameter provided, it's mostly a visual tool and not meant to be predictive in nature. Only after the strength number of bars has passed since the extreme point, the swing return value could be definitely set, thus the indicator updates its calculations as new incoming data warrants so.

You can access methods within this indicator to determine the number of bars ago a swing point occurred or the current swing value.

## Note

Tip: To workaround the situation, where the indicator has to recalculate \- you could only access the **SwingHigh** / **Low** values the number of swing strength bars ago \- those values are calculated in their final state.

## [Syntax \- Bars Ago](./swing.md)

**High Bar**

`Swing(int strength).SwingHighBar(int barsAgo, int instance, int lookBackPeriod`)

`Swing(ISeries<double> input, int strength).SwingHighBar(int barsAgo, int instance, int lookBackPeriod)`

**Low Bar**

`Swing(int strength).SwingLowBar(int barsAgo, int instance, int lookBackPeriod`)

`Swing(ISeries<double> input, int strength).SwingLowBar(int barsAgo, int instance, int lookBackPeriod)`

## [Return Value](./swing.md)

An **int** value representing the number of bars ago. Returns a value of \-1 if a swing point is not found within the look back period.

## [Syntax \- Value](./swing.md)

**High Value**

`Swing(int strength).SwingHigh[int barsAgo]`

`Swing(ISeries<double> input, int strength).SwingHigh[int barsAgo]`

**Low Value**

`Swing(int strength).SwingLow[int barsAgo]`

`Swing(ISeries<double> input, int strength).SwingLow[int barsAgo]`

## [Return Value](./swing.md)

**double;** Accessing this method via an index value `[int barsAgo]` returns the indicator value of the referenced bar.

*   A return value of 0 (zero) will be returned if the CurrentBar number is less than the "strength" value, or a swing pivot has not yet been found.

## [Parameters](./swing.md)

Parameter

Description

barsAgo

The number of bars ago that serves as the starting bar from which to work backwards

input

Indicator source data ([Series<`T`\>](./seriest.md))

instance

The occurrence to check for (1 is the most recent, 2 is the 2nd most recent, etc...)

lookBackPeriod

Number of bars to look back to check for the test condition, which is evaluated on the current bar and the bars in the look back period.

strength

The number of required bars to the left and right of the swing point

## [Examples](./swing.md)

```csharp
// Prints the high price of the most recent swing high
Print("The high of the swing bar is " + High[Math.Max(0, Swing(5).SwingHighBar(0, 1, 10))]);

```
