Disclaimer: The **SharpDX SDK Reference** section was compiled from the official **SharpDX Documentation** and was NOT authored by NinjaTrader. The contents of this section are provided as\-is and only cover a fraction of what is available from the SharpDX SDK. This page was intended only as a reference guide to help you get started with some of the 2D Graphics concepts used in the NinjaTrader.Custom assembly. Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run\-time environment. For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](./sharpdx_direct2d1_figurebegin.md)

Indicates whether a specific **GeometrySink** figure is filled or hollow.

(See also [unmanaged API documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd368106.aspx))

## [Syntax](./sharpdx_direct2d1_figurebegin.md)

`enum FigureBegin`

## [Enumerators](./sharpdx_direct2d1_figurebegin.md)

Filled

Indicates the figure will be filled by the **FillGeometry()** method

Hollow

Indicates the figure will not be filled by the **FillGeometry()** method and will only consist of an outline. Moreover, the bounds of a hollow figure are zero. **FigureBegin.Hollow** should be used for stroking, or for other geometry operations.
