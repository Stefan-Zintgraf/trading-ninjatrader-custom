You may have up to 65,535 unique `CandleOutlineBrushes` instances, therefore, using [static predefined brushes](./working_with_brushes.md) should be favored. Alternatively, in order to use fewer brushes, please try to cache your custom brushes until a new brush would actually need to be created.

## [Examples](./candleoutlinebrush.md)

// Sets the candle outline color to black
CandleOutlineBrush = Brushes.Black;
