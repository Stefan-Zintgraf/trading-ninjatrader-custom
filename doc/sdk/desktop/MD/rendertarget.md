## Note

Notes:

1.  There are two RenderTarget's used in a chart. This is important to understand when creating/destroying device resources. Please see the [OnRenderTargetChanged()](./onrendertargetchanged.md) page for more information.
2.  For a walk through for using the SharpDX RenderTarget, please see the educational resource [Using SharpDX for Custom Chart Rendering](./using_sharpdx_for_custom_chart_rendering.md).

## [Property Value](./rendertarget.md)

A [SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget](./sharpdx_direct2d1_rendertarget.md)

Property

Description

**SharpDX.Direct2D1.WindowRenderTarget**

Used to render the actual contents of the chart to the window

**SharpDX.Direct2D1.WicRenderTarget**

Used to render a bitmap for a few scenarios:

1.  A user clicks on a chart area; a bitmap is used to do any hit detection to determine where the user clicked.
2.  User clicks on the Windows task bar; a bitmap is used to render the preview of the contents of the chart display through a thumbnail on the task bar.
3.  A user re\-sizes the chart; a bitmap is used to render the current contents of the chart, which is redrawn using the WindowRenderTarget after the desired changes have been set.

## Warning

Warning: Each DirectX render target requires its own brushes. You must create brushes directly in [OnRender()](./onrender.md) or using [OnRenderTargetChanged()](./onrestorevalues.md). If you do not, you will receive an error at run time similar to:

"A direct X error has occurred while rendering the chart: HRESULT: \[0x88990015\], Module: \[SharpDX.Direct2D1\], ApiCode: \[D2DERR\_WRONG\_RESOURCE\_DOMAIN/WrongResourceDomain\], Message: The resource was realized on the wrong render target. : Each DirectX render target requires its own brushes. You must create brushes directly in OnRender() or using OnRenderTargetChanged().

Please see [OnRenderTargetChanged()](./onrendertargetchanged.md) for examples with brushes that need to be recalculated, or [OnRender()](./onrender.md) for an example of recreating a static brush.
