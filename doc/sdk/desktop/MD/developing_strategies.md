# Developing Strategies

NinjaScript allows you to develop custom strategies in rapid time by using over 100 built\-in system indicators, 3rd party indicators or **custom indicators**. NinjaScript strategies are compiled and run natively within the NinjaScript application providing the highest performance possible.

Please take the time to review this section including the [Strategy Development Process](./the_strategy_development_process.md).

Prior to running strategies live, please be sure to review the sections about [Strategy Position vs. Account Position](https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/NT%20HelpGuide%20English.html?strategy_position_vs_account_p.htm) and [Syncing Account Positions](https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpguides/nt8/?syncing_account_positions.htm).

All internal NinjaScript indicators and sample strategies come with full source code and can be viewed within the NinjaScript **Editor**. Please review the tutorials within this section for detailed walk throughs of custom strategy development.
