# Removing draw objects from the chart

# Removing draw objects from the chart

Drawing objects can be used for a number of different purposes, like keeping track of where a strategy has its entry point, profit target, and stop loss. If a strategy draws an object(s) for every trade it takes, the chart could quickly become cluttered. This sample will show how to remove the objects that aren't necessary anymore.
