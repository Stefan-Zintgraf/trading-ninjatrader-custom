# Using IsRising and IsFalling conditions in the Strategy Builder

# Using IsRising and IsFalling conditions in the Strategy Builder

NinjaTrader's Strategy Builder includes access to many methods and properties, including the IsRising() and IsFalling() methods. It is possible to check if an indicator (or any `Series<t>`) is rising or falling using these methods. You can also use High values, Low values, or any other `Series<t>` with IsRising() or IsFalling() to qualitatively determine the direction of the DataSeries. This simple sample demonstrates IsRising() and IsFalling() in the Strategy Builder.
