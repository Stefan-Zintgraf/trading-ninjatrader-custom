# GetRealtimeOrder()

# GetRealtimeOrder()

## [Definition](./getrealtimeorder.md)

Returns a matching real\-time order object based on a specified historical order object reference.

## Note

This method is only needed if you have historical order references which you wish to transition and manage in real\-time (i.e., you had a working order which was submitted historically and re\-submitted in real\-time as the strategy is enabled). This method only needs to be called once per order object, and should be done in OnOrderUpdate to handle all scenarios. Please see the [Advanced Order Handling](./advanced_order_handling.md) section on transition orders for more details.

## [Method Return Value](./getrealtimeorder.md)

Returns a real\-time [order](./order.md) reference associated with the historical order object. If no associated order exists (i.e. OrderState is Filled, Canceled, Rejected, Unknown), a null value returns.

## [Syntax](./getrealtimeorder.md)

`GetRealtimeOrder(Order historicalOrder)`

## [Parameters](./getrealtimeorder.md)

historicalOrder

The historical [order](./order.md) object to update to real\-time

## [Examples](./getrealtimeorder.md)

```csharp
private Order myOrder;

protected override void OnOrderUpdate(Order order, double limitPrice, double stopPrice, int quantity, int filled, double averageFillPrice, OrderState orderState, DateTime time, ErrorCode error, string nativeError)
{
    // One time only, as we transition from historical
    // Convert any old historical order object references to the live order submitted to the real-time account
    if (myOrder != null && myOrder.IsBacktestOrder && State == State.Realtime)
        myOrder = GetRealtimeOrder(myOrder);

    // Assign Order objects here
    // This is more reliable than assigning Order objects in OnBarUpdate, as the assignment is not guaranteed to be complete if it is referenced immediately after submitting
    if (order.Name == "myOrder Signal Name")
        myOrder = order;

    // Null Entry order if filled or cancelled. We do not use the Order objects after the order is filled, so we can null it here
    if (myOrder != null && myOrder == order)
    {
        if (order.OrderState == OrderState.Cancelled && order.Filled == 0)
            myOrder = null;
        if (order.OrderState == OrderState.Filled)
            myOrder = null;
    }
}

```
