## Note

In most cases, you will access the historical price series using a core event handler such as **OnBarUpdate**. For more advanced developers, you may find situations where you wish to access historical price series outside of the core event methods, such as your own custom mouse click. In these advanced scenarios, you may run into situations where the **barsAgo** pointer is not in sync with the current bar, which may cause errors when trying to obtain this information. In those cases, please use the **Bars.Get...()** methods with the absolute bar index, e.g., [**Bars.GetClose()**](./getclose.md), [**Bars.GetOpen()**](./getopen.md), etc.
