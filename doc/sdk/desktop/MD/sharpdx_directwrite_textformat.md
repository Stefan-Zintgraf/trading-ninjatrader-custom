## Warning

Disclaimer: The **SharpDX SDK Reference** section was compiled from the official **SharpDX Documentation** and was NOT authored by NinjaTrader. The contents of this section are provided as\-is and only cover a fraction of what is available from the SharpDX SDK. This page was intended only as a reference guide to help you get started with some of the 2D Graphics concepts used in the NinjaTrader.Custom assembly. Please refer to the official SharpDX Documentation for additional members not covered in this reference. For more seasoned graphic developers, the original MSDN **Direct2D1** and **DirectWrite** unmanaged API documentation can also be helpful for understanding the DirectX/Direct2D run\-time environment. For NinjaScript development purposes, we document only essential members in the structure of this page.

## [Definition](./sharpdx_directwrite_textformat.md)

The `TextFormat` interface describes the font and paragraph properties used to format text, and it describes locale information.

(See also [unmanaged API documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd316628.aspx))

## Note

Notes:

1.  These properties cannot be changed after the `TextFormat` object is created. To change these properties, a new `TextFormat` object must be created with the desired properties.
2.  The **TextFormat** interface is used to draw text with a single format. To draw text with multiple formats, or to use a custom text renderer, use the [TextLayout](./sharpdx_directwrite_textlayout.md) interface. **TextLayout** enables the application to change the format for ranges of text within the string.
3.  This object may not be thread\-safe, and it may carry the state of text format change.
4.  To draw simple text with a single format, Direct2D provides the [DrawText()](./sharpdx_direct2d1_rendertarget_drawtext.md) method, which draws a string using the format information provided by a **TextFormat** object.

## Note

Tip: For NinjaScript development purposes, when creating a **TextFormat** object you should use the [NinjaTrader.Core.Globals.DirectWriteFactory](./directwritefactory.md) property.
