# ForceRefresh()

# ForceRefresh()

## [Definition](./forcerefresh.md)

Resets an internal marker used to determine if the chart visuals need to re\-render.

[ChartControl](./chartcontrol.md) runs a timed event every 250ms to determine the chart needs to be updated. If it does, the **OnRender()** method is called. Under normal circumstances, the marker used to call **OnRender()** will be reset after the following conditions:

*   **OnBarUpdate()** event
*   **OnConnectionStatusUpdate()** event
*   User clicks on the chart
*   Drawing object(s) have been removed from the chart
*   Strategy enabled/disabled on chart
*   ChartTrader enabled/disabled

In most cases, the conditions listed above should be satisfactory for rendering standard and custom chart objects; however for more advanced programming concepts, there may be other situations you run into which would NOT force the chart to refresh (e.g., a user interacting with a custom control). In these special cases, you can use the **ForceRefresh()** method to re\-queue the render event.

## Note

As the chart is optimized on a timer, calling **ForceRefresh()** will NOT immediately trigger a render event. Calling **ForceRefresh()** simply re\-queues the render event to trigger during the next timed event. In other words, it may take up to 250ms for the render event to function.

## [Method Return Value](./forcerefresh.md)

This method does not return a value.

## [Syntax](./forcerefresh.md)

`ForceRefresh()`

## [Method Parameters](./forcerefresh.md)

This method does not accept any parameters.

## [Examples](./forcerefresh.md)

```csharp
DateTime lastTimeCalled = DateTime.MinValue;

private void MyCustomMethod()
{
    // if it has been longer than one second since the last time
    // this method was called update the chart visually
    if (Core.Globals.Now.Subtract(lastTimeCalled).Seconds >= 1)
    {
        ForceRefresh();
        lastTimeCalled = Core.Globals.Now;
    }
}

```

## Warning

Excessive calls to **ForceRefresh()** and **OnRender()** can carry an impact on general application performance. You should only call **ForceRefresh()** if the chart truly needs to be visually updated. It is NOT recommended to invalidate the chart control directly as this could cause issues with threading which result in dead locks.
