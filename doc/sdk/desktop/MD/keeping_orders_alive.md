# Keeping orders alive

# Keeping orders alive

The default behavior for **NinjaTrader** is to cancel limit orders if the trigger conditions are no longer true. It is possible to submit orders that stay active until cancelled by setting **liveUntilCancelled** to true. This sample demonstrates and explains the difference between submitting an order with **isLiveUntilCancelled** true and false. The comments contain a longer, more detailed explanation.
