# Using a Series or DataSeries object to store calculations

# Using a Series or DataSeries object to store calculations

When creating Indicators or Strategies you may find that you need to store values in a way that is similar to the way price data is stored in NinjaTrader.

`Series<T>` objects are useful for storing various types of values.

Since they are linked to your historical bars object, you can store and link a value to each bar. This allows you the flexibility of accessing the values at any point in the future for further calculations or plotting.
