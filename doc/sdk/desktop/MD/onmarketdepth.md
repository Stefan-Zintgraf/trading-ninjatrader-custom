# OnMarketDepth()

# OnMarketDepth()

## [Definition](./onmarketdepth.md)

An event driven method which is called and guaranteed to be in the correct sequence for every change in level two market data (market depth) for the underlying instrument. The **OnMarketDepth()** method can be used to build your own level two book.

## Note

1.  This is a real\-time data stream and can be CPU intensive if your program code is compute intensive (not optimal)
2.  This method is not called on historical data (backtest)

## [Method Return Value](./onmarketdepth.md)

This method does not return a value.

## [Syntax](./onmarketdepth.md)

You must override the method in your strategy or indicator with the following syntax:

`protected override void OnMarketDepth(MarketDepthEventArgs marketDepthUpdate)`

## Note

The NinjaScript code wizards can automatically generate the method syntax for you when creating a new script.

## [Parameters](./onmarketdepth.md)

marketDepthUpdate

**MarketDepthEventArgs** representing the recent change in market data

## [Examples](./onmarketdepth.md)

```csharp
protected override void OnMarketDepth(MarketDepthEventArgs marketDepthUpdate)
{
     // Print some data to the Output window
     if (marketDepthUpdate.MarketDataType == MarketDataType.Ask && marketDepthUpdate.Operation == Operation.Update)
         Print(string.Format("The most recent ask change is {0} {1}", marketDepthUpdate.Price, marketDepthUpdate.Volume));
}

```

## Note

*   1.  With [multi\-time frame and instrument strategies](./multi_time_frame_instruments.md), **OnMarketDepth** will be called for all unique instruments in your strategy. Use the [BarsInProgress](./barsinprogress.md) to filter the **OnMarketDepth()** method for a specific instrument. (BarsInProgress will return the first BarsInProgress series that matches the instrument for the event)
*   2.  Do not leave an unused **OnMarketDepth()** method declared in your NinjaScript object. This will unnecessarily attach a data stream to your strategy which uses unnecessary CPU cycles.
*   3.  Should you wish to run comparisons against prior values you will need to store and update local variables to track the relevant values.
*   4.  With NinjaTrader being multi\-threaded, you should not rely on any particular sequence of events like **OnMarketDepth()** always being called before **OnMarketData()** or vice versa.
